            <h3>2023-2025: Success Typing</h3>

            <p>Success types aim to have a dual assertion to the one made in 
				most type systems: that if a program is ill-typed, then the 
				program will not evaluate. The goal of my project was to
				rigorously specify success types and create a proof of 
				correctness for them. The proof ended up requiring step-indexed 
				logical relations. I presented an in-progress poster of this work at 
				POPL 2025 SRC.

            <h3>2023 Spring: Cypher Semantics</h3>

            <p>Cypher is a graph query language that increased in popularity
				with the rise of commercial graph databases. A semantics for 
				Cypher was already written out, and my goal in this project 
				was to translate those semantics into the Rocq prover (then 
				called Coq).

            <h3>2022 Fall: Analyzing SSH Attackers</h3>

            <p>The goal of this semester long project was to explore the 
				connection between attacker behavior on an open SSH server 
				and the content of a webpage hosted on the same system. Our team
				created a set of robust internet-facing honeypots and used 
				a Man-in-the-Middle server to capture data.
